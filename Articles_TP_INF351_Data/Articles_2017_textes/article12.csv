3D Convolutional Networks for Session-based Recommendation with Content Features

In many real-life recommendation settings, user profiles and past activities are not available. The recommender system should make predictions based on session data, e.g. session clicks and descriptions of clicked items. Conventional recommendation approaches, which rely on past user-item interaction data, cannot deliver accurate results in these situations. In this paper, we describe a method that combines session clicks and content features such as item descriptions and item categories to generate recommendations. To model these data, which are usually of different types and nature, we use 3-dimensional convolutional neural networks with character-level encoding of all input data. While 3D architectures provide a natural way to capture spatio-temporal patterns, character-level networks allow modeling different data types using their raw textual representation, thus reducing feature engineering effort. We applied the proposed method to predict add-to-cart events in e-commerce websites, which is more difficult then predicting next clicks. On two real datasets, our method outperformed several baselines and a state-of-the-art method based on recurrent neural networks.
