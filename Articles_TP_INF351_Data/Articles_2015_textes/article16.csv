The Web has grown into one of the most important channels to communicate social events nowadays. However, the sheer volume of events available in event-based social networks (EBSNs) often undermines the users' ability to choose the events that best fit their interests. Recommender systems appear as a natural solution for this problem, but differently from classic recommendation scenarios (e.g. movies, books), the event recommendation problem is intrinsically cold-start. Indeed, events published in EBSNs are typically short-lived and, by definition, are always in the future, having little or no trace of historical attendance. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit several contextual signals available from EBSNs. In particular, besides content-based signals based on the events' description and collaborative signals derived from users' RSVPs, we exploit social signals based on group memberships, location signals based on the users' geographical preferences, and temporal signals derived from the users' time preferences. Moreover, we combine the proposed signals for learning to rank events for personalized recommendation. Thorough experiments using a large crawl of Meetup.com demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed contextual learning approach in contrast to state-of-the-art event recommenders from the literature.
