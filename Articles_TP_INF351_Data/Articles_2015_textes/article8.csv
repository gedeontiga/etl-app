Top-N Recommendation for Shared Accounts
Koen Verstrepen, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium|Bart Goethals, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium
Standard collaborative filtering recommender systems assume that every account in the training data represents a single user. However, multiple users often share a single account. A typical example is a single shopping account for the whole family. Traditional recommender systems fail in this situation. If contextual information is available, context aware recommender systems are the state-of-the-art solution. Yet, often no contextual information is available. Therefore, we introduce the challenge of recommending to shared accounts in the absence of contextual information. We propose a solution to this challenge for all cases in which the reference recommender system is an item-based top-N collaborative filtering recommender system, generating recommendations based on binary, positive-only feedback. We experimentally show the advantages of our proposed solution for tackling the problems that arise from the existence of shared accounts on multiple datasets.
