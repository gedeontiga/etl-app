With the increasing accessibility of transactional data in venture finance, venture capital firms (VCs) face great challenges in developing quantitative tools to identify new investment opportunities. Recommendation techniques have the possibility of helping VCs making data-driven investment decisions by providing an automatic screening process of a large number of startups across different domains on the basis of their past investment data. A previous study has shown the potential advantage of using collaborative filtering to catch and predict the VCs' investment behaviours. However, two fundamental challenges in venture finance make conventional recommendation techniques difficult to apply. First, risk factors should be cautiously considered when making investments: for a potential startup, a VC needs to specifically estimate how well this new investment can fit into its holding investment portfolio in such a way that investment risk can be hedged. Second, The investment behaviours are much sparser than conventional recommendation applications and a VC's investments are usually limited to a few industry categories, making it impossible to use a topic-diversification method to hedge the risk. In this paper, we solve the startup recommendation problem from a risk management perspective. We propose 5 risk-aware startup selection and ranking algorithms to catch the VCs' investment behaviours and predict their new investments. Apart from the contribution on the new risk-aware recommendation model, our experiments on the collected CrunchBase dataset show significant performance improvements over strong baselines.
