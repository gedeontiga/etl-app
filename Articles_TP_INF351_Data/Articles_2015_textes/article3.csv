Studies have shown that the recommendation of unseen, novel or serendipitous items is crucial for a satisfying and engaging user experience. As a result, recent developments in recommendation research have increasingly focused towards introducing novelty in user recommendation lists. While, existing solutions aim to find the right balance between the similarity and novelty of the recommended items, they largely ignore the user needs for novelty. In this paper, we show that there are large individual and temporal differences in the users' novelty preferences. We develop a regression model to predict these dynamic novelty preferences of users using features derived from their past interactions. Finally, we describe an adaptive recommender,~emph{adaNov-R}, that adapts to the user needs for novel items and show that the model achieves better recommendation performance on a metric that considers both novel and familiar items.
