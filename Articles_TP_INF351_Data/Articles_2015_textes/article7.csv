The significance of social-enhanced recommender systems is increasing, along with its practicality, as online reviews, ratings, friendship links, and follower relationships are increasingly becoming available. In recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information, such as trust and distrust relations in recommendation algorithms. The goal is to improve the quality of suggestions and mitigate the data sparsity and the cold-start users problems in existing systems. In this paper, we introduce a general collaborative social ranking model to rank the latent features of users extracted from rating data based on the social context of users. In contrast to existing social regularization methods, the proposed framework is able to simultaneously leverage trust, distrust, and neutral relations, and has a linear dependency on the social network size. By integrating the ranking based social regularization idea into the matrix factorization algorithm, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm, dubbed PushTrust. Our experiments on the Epinions dataset demonstrate that collaboratively ranking the latent features of users by exploiting trust and distrust relations leads to a substantial increase in performance, and to effectively deal with cold-start users problem.
